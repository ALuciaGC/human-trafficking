## README

The prupose of this study is to map geographical patterns in which human trafficking networks work, based on the victims' country of origin and the type of exploitation imposed on them. In terms of contribution, this analysis intends to bring light to a historically furtive movement, allowing awareness campaigns both in humanitarian assistance, and in the criminal justice area. 

The base of the analysis will come from the Counter Trafficking Data Collaborative's global data set on human trafficking (https://www.ctdatacollaborative.org/). 

A much expected limitation is the robustness of the information provided. The very nature of the subject is highly related with furtivness and irregularity, and victims are, more often than not, not kept in record. The dataset itself has considerable missing observations.
